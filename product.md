# Sorbit – Product Definition

## 1. What Sorbit Is

Sorbit is a web-based social media management platform that allows users to:

- Connect multiple social media accounts in one place  
- View analytics for each account  
- Create and publish content across selected platforms from a single dashboard  

The goal is to remove the friction of switching between apps and make social media management simple, fast, and accessible.

Sorbit is built primarily for everyday creators, students, small businesses, and communities — especially within Africa and emerging markets.
